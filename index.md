Welcome to Dimsumlabs!
The first and only [hackerspace](/about/) in Hong Kong, a place where technology enthusiasts get together as a community to tinker with technology, meet and work on projects, exchange ideas and experience and to learn from each other.

There is a weekly open meeting on [**Tuesdays at 8pm (20:00)**](/find_us/).
Come join us to see for yourself what it's all about!
