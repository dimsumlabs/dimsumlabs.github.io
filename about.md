We’re Hong Kong’s first and only [Hackerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) (or hacklab, or makerspace, or hackspace), open to anyone interested in *hacking*: the intellectual challenge to creatively overcome, circumvent, deconstruct or otherwise “hack” the limitations, capabilities, purposes, forms, etc. of virtually anything — or in other words: to mess around with [anything] for fun.

## Community
We are a community operated non-profit open to all people who wants to explore technology as a part of a welcoming community

As a hacker community we subscribe to the [hacker ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic#The_hacker_ethics).<br />
Hacking systems is cool, leaking personal information is not.<br />
Building a high powered laser contraption is cool, dont use it on your cat though.<br />
In short, make robots not bombs!
